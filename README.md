# Inkplate 10 mount

A mounting plate for the [Inkplate 10](https://www.crowdsupply.com/soldered/inkplate-10) e-paper display. Intended to be laser cut from acrylic, plywood, etc.

Based off `Inkplate10_Case_v1.6_Bottom.stl` from [Inkplate-10-hardware GitHub repo](https://github.com/SolderedElectronics/Inkplate-10-hardware/tree/main/3D%20printable%20case/Original%20case).

This design was never manufactured and the project was abandoned in favour of [this one](https://github.com/PhilboBaggins/inkplate-10-mount-laser-cut).
